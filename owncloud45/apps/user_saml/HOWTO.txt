EXTRA INFO
==========

* If you enable the "Autocreate user after saml login" option, then if an user does not exist, will be created. If this option is disabled and the user does not existed then the user will be not allowed to log in Owncloud.


* If you enable the "Update user data" option, when an existed user enter, then his email and groups will be updated.

  By default the SAML App will unlink all the groups from a user and will provide the group defined at the groupMapping attribute. If the groupMapping is not defined
  the value of the defaultGroup field will be used instead. If both are undefined, then the user will be set with no groups.
  But if you configure the "protected groups" field, those groups will not be unlinked from the user.
